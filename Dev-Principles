SOLID

Single responsibility principle
A class should only have a single responsibility, that is, only changes to one part of the software's specification 
should be able to affect the specification of the class.

Openâ€“closed principle
"Software entities ... should be open for extension, but closed for modification."

Liskov substitution principle
"Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of 
that program." See also design by contract.

Interface segregation principle
"Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface."

Dependency inversion principle[
One should "depend upon abstractions, [not] concretions."

IoC (Inversion of control)
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_control

 IoC inverts the flow of control as compared to traditional control flow. In IoC, custom-written portions of a 
 computer program receive the flow of control from a generic framework. A software architecture with this design 
 inverts control as compared to traditional procedural programming: in traditional programming, the custom code 
 that expresses the purpose of the program calls into reusable libraries to take care of generic tasks, but with 
 inversion of control, it is the framework that calls into the custom, or task-specific, code.

 YAGNI (You aren't gonna need it)
 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren't_gonna_need_it
 
 "You aren't gonna need it" (YAGNI) is a principle of extreme programming (XP) that states a programmer should not add 
 functionality until deemed necessary.[4] XP co-founder Ron Jeffries has written: "Always implement things when you 
 actually need them, never when you just foresee that you need them." Other forms of the phrase include "You aren't 
 going to need it" and "You ain't gonna need it".
