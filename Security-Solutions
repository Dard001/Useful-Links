Outcome: 
•	Perform manual and automated code reviews using certified personnel and/or accepted software such as Fortify.

1.36	Cloud Migration
Definition: Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.
Requirements:
•	Rapidly migrate our data processing and storage to the cloud with a supporting policy framework that allows for effective cyberspace security and defensive maneuver. (AFSPC/CC)
Outcome:
•	Use one of the many cloud service offerings
•	Cloud Requirements:
o	PKI/MFA
o	STIG Application
o	DNS Server with DNSSEC (SC-20)

2	APPENDIX A – Cyber Security Concepts
In order to secure the Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability of a system, cyber security engineers will employ a variety of concepts in order to guide the selection of technical solutions.  

2.1	Confidentiality
Preserving authorized restrictions on information access and disclosure, including means for protecting personal privacy and proprietary information.

2.2	Integrity
Guarding against improper information modification or destruction, and includes ensuring information non-repudiation and authenticity.

2.3	Availability
Ensuring timely and reliable access to and use of information.

2.4	Authentication
Verifying the identity of a user, process, or device, often as a prerequisite to allowing access to resources in an information system.
A security measure designed to protect a communications system against acceptance of fraudulent transmission or simulation by establishing the validity of a transmission, message, originator, or a means of verifying an individual's eligibility to receive specific categories of information.

2.5	Authorization
Access privileges granted to a user, program, or process or the act of granting those privileges.

2.6	Accountability
The security goal that generates the requirement for actions of an entity to be traced uniquely to that entity.  This supports non-repudiation, deterrence, fault isolation, intrusion detection and prevention, and after-action recovery and legal action. 

2.7	Non-Repudiation
Protection against an individual falsely denying having performed a particular action.  Provides the capability to determine whether a given individual took a particular action such as creating information, sending a message, approving information, and receiving a message.

2.8	Continuous Monitoring
Maintaining ongoing awareness of information security, vulnerabilities, and threats to support organizational risk management decisions.  

2.9	Encryption (In Transit & At Rest)
The cryptographic transformation of data to produce ciphertext.
Data in transit is defined into two categories, information that flows over the public or untrusted network such as the internet and data which flows in the confines of a private network such as a corporate or enterprise Local Area Network (LAN).
Data at rest is an information technology term referring to inactive data which is stored physically in any digital form

2.10	Device Hardening
Providing various means of protection in a computer system. Protection is provided in various layers and is often referred to as defense in depth. Protecting in layers means to protect at the host level, the application level, the operating system level, the user level, the physical level and all the sublevels in between. Each level requires a unique method of security.

2.11	Central Management
The centralized management and configuration of user nodes and devices by an authoritative source.

2.12	Boundary Protection
Monitoring and control of communications at the external boundary of an information system to prevent and detect malicious and other unauthorized communications, through the use of boundary protection devices (e.g. gateways, routers, firewalls, guards, encrypted tunnels).

2.13	Network Defense
Programs, activities, and the use of tools necessary to facilitate them (including those governed by NSPD-54/HSPD-23 and NSD-42) conducted on a computer, network, or information or communications system by the owner or with the consent of the owner and, as  appropriate, the users for the primary purpose of protecting (1) that computer, network, or system; (2) data stored on, processed on, or transiting that computer, network, or system; or (3) physical and virtual infrastructure controlled by that computer, network, or system.  Network defense does not involve or require accessing or conducting activities on computers, networks, or information or communications systems without authorization from the owners or exceeding access authorized by the owners.

2.14	Data Loss Protection (In Transit & At Rest)
A systems ability to identify, monitor, and protect data in use (e.g. endpoint actions), data in motion (e.g. network actions), and data at rest (e.g. data storage) through deep packet content inspection, contextual security analysis of transaction (attributes of originator, data object, medium, timing, recipient/destination, etc.), within a centralized management framework. Data loss prevention capabilities are designed to detect and prevent the unauthorized use and transmission of NSS information.

2.15	Backup/Restore
A copy of files and programs made to facilitate recovery, if necessary.

2.16	Redundancy
Redundancy is a system design in which a component is duplicated so if it fails there will be a backup.

2.17	Documentation
The documentation of configurations, diagrams, policies, and procedures regarding a system and its components.

2.18	Emission Security
The component of communications security that results from all measures taken to deny unauthorized persons information of value that might be derived from intercept and analysis of compromising emanations from cryptoequipment and information systems.

2.19	Red/Black Concept
Separation of electrical and electronic circuits, components, equipment, and systems that handle national security information (RED), in electrical form, from those that handle non-national security information (BLACK) in the same form.
